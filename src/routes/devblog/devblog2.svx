## Description
I have now implemented the full login and registration system, including handling user credentials in localStorage. I also added a particles animation for a more engaging experience, which appears behind the login section. <br>Additionally, I created a Wordle game placeholder. The dark/light theme toggle functionality has been retained and works seamlessly. (kinda)

<br> My priority going forward is polishing the Wordle game and refining the login systemâ€™s design and user interactions. With making the wordle functional and finished.

## Changes
The following changes and implementations have been made in this version of the project:

* Complete login and registration system (using localStorage)

* Smooth scroll functionality for navigation links

* Particle animation added to the login screen

* Wordle game placeholder added

* Transition animations for login/register forms

* Dark Mode/Light Mode toggle remains functional

* Social login buttons for Google and Microsoft integration (buttons styled but non-functional)
